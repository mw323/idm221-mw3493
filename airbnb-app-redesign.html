                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>As my class project, I redesigned the Airbnb app to enhance usability and refine the interaction flow. 
                My goal was to create a more intuitive and engaging booking experience by introducing microinteractions that make browsing and payment smoother.</p>

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>Airbnb is a global platform that enables users to find and book short-term accommodations and experiences offered by hosts around the world. It has become one of the most popular travel platforms due to its convenience, variety of listings, 
                    and community-based model. However, users often face challenges such as excessive scrolling, scattered information, and a lack of personalized recommendations. 
                    These issues can make it harder to browse efficiently and find suitable stays.</p>

                    <p>Airbnb targets modern, experience driven travelers who value flexibility, unique stays, and a home-like environment. 
                    They seek convenient booking, reliable amenities, and authentic local experiences rather than traditional hotel stays.</p>

                    <p>Sophie is a 24-year-old product designer from Atlanta who travels frequently for inspiration and relaxation. 
                    She values stylish, convenient, and well-designed stays near city centers, and she wants a smooth browsing experience 
                    with clear information and personalized recommendations to quickly find the right place.</p>

                <div class="problem1">
                    <h3>Homepage Requires Excessive Scrolling</h3>
                    <p>The existing homepage presents listings in a long vertical feed with randomized content. 
                    Users must continuously scroll to explore different stays, and there is no clear categorization or personalization.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="problem2">
                    <h3>Listing Details Page Lacks Information Classification</h3>
                    <p>Key information — such as amenities, reviews, house rules, and host details is displayed on one long-scrolling page rather than divided into clear sections. 
                    As a result, important content becomes difficult to locate, forcing users to scroll continuously until they find what they need.</p>

            <section class="solution">

                <div class="solution1">
                    <h3>Horizontal layout and categorized browsing</h3>
                    <p>The homepage was redesigned to include personalized categories such as For You and Popular. 
                    A card carousel replaced the long vertical feed, allowing users to swipe horizontally and browse more listings with less scrolling.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="solution2">
                    <h3>Tabbed information structure</h3>
                    <p>Listing details were reorganized using a tabbed layout that separates key information like Overview, Amenities, Reviews, and Policies. 
                    This structure makes it easier for users to find what they need quickly without endless scrolling.</p>

                <h2>Interaction Enhancement</h2>
                <p class="line_1">While Airbnb's existing payment process is already straightforward and functional, 
                I saw an opportunity to make it more engaging through motion and micro-interaction.</p>
                <p class="line_2">I designed a vertical loop-scrolling payment selector that allows users to smoothly swipe through different types of cards in a continuous motion. 
                When a card is selected, it expands with an animated reveal showing the card information fields and a next button, creating a seamless and visually engaging checkout experience.</p>

                    <h3>Increased browsing efficiency</h3>
                    <p>The redesigned horizontal layout lets users see more listings at once and find what they want faster, making browsing smoother and easier.</p>

                <div class="result2">
                    <h3>Better information accessibility</h3>

                    <h3>Positive user feedback</h3>
